## 📌 What’s Inside?
### 🔹 1. Loading the Data
- Importing CSV files using read_csv()
- Creating and understanding DataFrames and Series
- Basic info on shape, data types, and column names

### 🔹 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Getting an overview using head(), info(), describe()
- Checking null values, unique entries, and value counts
- Grouping and summarizing with groupby()

### 🔹 3. Data Cleaning
- Handling missing values with fillna() and dropna()
- Fixing inconsistent column names
- Removing duplicates and irrelevant data

### 🔹 4. Data Transformation
- Creating new calculated columns using apply() and lambda
- Type conversions, renaming columns
-Applying business logic (e.g., calculating occupancy percentage)

### 🔹 5. Generating Insights
- Drawing conclusions from cleaned & transformed data
- Using filters, conditions, and aggregations to find patterns
- Interpreting results to support business decisions

### 🔹 6. Visualization (Preview)
- A sneak peek into Matplotlib to turn insights into visuals
- Example: Pie chart showing revenue distribution by platform

### 🎥 Conclusion :
- This project was part of a learning series where we compared Pandas with tools like Excel, SQL, and Power BI, highlighting where Pandas shines in terms of flexibility and control.

#### 💡 Ideal For:
- Python beginners exploring data analysis
- Anyone transitioning from Excel/Power BI to Python
